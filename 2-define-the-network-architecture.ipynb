The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n\nNote: During training, PyTorch will be able to perform backpropagation by keeping track of the network's feedforward behavior and using autograd to calculate the update to the weights in the network.\n\n#### Define the Layers in ` __init__`\nAs a reminder, a conv/pool layer may be defined like this (in `__init__`):\n```\n# 1 input image channel (for grayscale images), 32 output channels/feature maps, 3x3 square convolution kernel\nself.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, 3)\n\n# maxpool that uses a square window of kernel_size=2, stride=2\nself.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)      \n```\n\n#### Refer to Layers in `forward`\nThen referred to in the `forward` function like this, in which the conv1 layer has a ReLu activation applied to it before maxpooling is applied:\n```\nx = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n```\n\nBest practice is to place any layers whose weights will change during the training process in `__init__` and refer to them in the `forward` function; any layers or functions that always behave in the same way, such as a pre-defined activation function, should appear *only* in the `forward` function.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Why models.py\n\nYou are tasked with defining the network in the `models.py` file so that any models you define can be saved and loaded by name in different notebooks in this project directory.

As a CNN trains, it learns what weights to include in it's convolutional kernels and when these kernels are applied to some input image, they produce a set of **feature maps**. So, feature maps are just sets of filtered images; they are the images produced by applying a convolutional kernel to an input image. These maps show us the features that the different layers of the neural network learn to extract. For example, you might imagine a convolutional kernel that detects the vertical edges of a face or another one that detects the corners of eyes.
