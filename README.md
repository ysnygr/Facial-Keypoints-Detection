# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

This project, I trained a CNN model which predict the locations of keypoints around eyes, mouth, nose on face. 


You don't need to use GPU but with GPU, training time 4-5 times short.

**This project is generated using lectures of Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree programme.**
